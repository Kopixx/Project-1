    "What are the main influences on Property Prices in Melbourne?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this question, we are investigating the key attributes that contribute to deciding property prices. It considers dependent variables such as land size, building size, number and types of rooms, parking availability, property type, year built and time of sale. This will provide valuable insight to buyers, understanding what trade-offs may affect their budget as they look to enter the market, alongside providing sellers with some prediction modelling, basing their expected sale prices upon the attributes relevant to their property.
